This one may contain trace elements of hurt feelings, identity loss and figuring out one's own life all over again. This one can also show you if you're a person or an asshole.

### coffee intro, August 2019

I am pacing nervously in the living room. The university and home is the only two places I know how to get to. True, in April I was in the downtown but I have no idea how to get there now. And my own timidity and too many episodes of CSI TV shows don't really help to be brave to explore the city on my own. At least not yet. Also, I don't really understand the bus timetables. Who names bus stops by the streets that cross nearby anyways?

So I probe Instagram profiles of my classmates hoping to find someone with the same condition I have: cofee people with a serious reading problem. They might know a coffee place or two near the campus. If I knew how much trouble this would cause in a month or so I wouldn't have done it. But at this point I know nothing. The nearest coffee place  called <a href="https://recesscoffee.com">Recess</a> is 30 minutes from me. Yay! Let's walk there. Go by the cemetery, don't get run over by a car on the crosswalk that says go but shows you to stop at the same time (look, <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu">the university where you are a student now!</a>), 4 block through the street full of undergrads playing beerpong, turn right before the church, two more blocks, don't trip, and you're there. Phew. I kinda miss Prague trams already.
